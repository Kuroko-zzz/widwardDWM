# widwardDWM

Basically this is just my rice of dwm. Enjoy :)

installing:

there will be multiple folders, just cd into for each one you want to install and then run sudo make install

also you will most likely want to install nitrogen and picom: these are most likely availible in your distro's package manager

i deleted all of the useless directories

also this repo is meant to be in your home folder. if you change the directory of the folder, then you have to change the path of the scripts in dwmblocks
