# widwardDWM

Basically this is just my rice of dwm. Enjoy :)

installing:

there will be multiple folders, just cd into for each one you want to install and then run sudo make install

also you will most likely want to install nitrogen and picom: these are most likely availible in your distro's package manager

you can use dwm-6.2 if you want but i dont work on it
